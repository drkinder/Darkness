# Darkness
A 2D Adventure/Puzzle Video Game in Pygame. Still requires a lot of development.

## Concept
A boy is lost at night in total darkness. He must explore the world around him with nothing but a flashlight who's batteries are draining.
There are a variety of shadow monsters on the lose who want to eat him. His only defense is to shine his light at them, causing them to flee.
In a race against his draining batteries, he must find his way through the maze without being eaten alive.
